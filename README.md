# @haiyue/ui

Dependency-free Web Components for HaiyueStudio products. Components own presentation and local interaction;
they do not depend on Engine, Editor, Games, or AIStudio state.

```bash
npm install @haiyue/ui
```

## Import only what a product uses

Each component has an isolated package subpath. Importing a subpath loads only that component and its direct
helpers, and registration stays explicit:

```ts
import { defineButtonComponents } from '@haiyue/ui/button';
import { defineTreeComponents } from '@haiyue/ui/tree';

defineButtonComponents();
defineTreeComponents();
```

The package declares `sideEffects: false`, does not register custom elements during module evaluation, and
publishes matching JavaScript and type declarations for every subpath. This lets bundlers exclude components
that are not reachable from the selected imports.

The root entry remains available when an application intentionally wants every component:

```ts
import { defineHaiyueUI } from '@haiyue/ui';

defineHaiyueUI();
```

Because `defineHaiyueUI()` references the complete component set, prefer focused subpaths in bundle-sensitive
product entry points.

## Component examples

Run the interactive component gallery locally:

```bash
npm run examples
```

Then open <http://localhost:4173/>. The gallery provides a left-side component index and live examples for
every exported component, including editable parameters and event output.
